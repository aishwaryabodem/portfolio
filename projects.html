    <h3>Manufacturing Of Compact Conveyor System </h3>
    <p>
This project focused on the design and manufacturing of a compact conveyor system for efficient material handling and multi-purpose adaptability. It involved requirement analysis, conceptual and detailed mechanical design, and layout planning. Suitable materials were selected to ensure strength, durability, and compactness while maintaining cost efficiency. The system was designed to support smooth material flow and reliable operation under practical load conditions.

The work included component fabrication, mechanical assembly, and alignment of the conveyor structure and belt mechanism. Functional and performance testing were carried out to evaluate operational efficiency, load capacity, and system stability. The final system met functional requirements and demonstrated reliable performance in real-world industrial environments.
