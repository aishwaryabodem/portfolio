    <p>
A detail-oriented and adaptable individual with a foundation in mechanical engineering, manufacturing systems, and production support. I have hands-on exposure to material planning, inventory management, and production operations through SAP-based workflows and shop-floor coordination. I value accuracy, structured processes, and clear technical documentation, and I adapt quickly to new systems and operational environments. I am motivated to contribute to mechanical and production-focused roles by supporting efficient planning, reliable operations, and continuous process improvement while expanding my engineering and industrial knowledge.    </p>
